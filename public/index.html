        FitLife was created to solve the biggest gym problem that enthusiast face when going to 
        a local gym. We offer an abundance of equipment that ranges from treadmills to olympic grade
        racks. Also, we understand that there are beginners and long time lifters. For this reason we
        have private rooms to enter and not be disturbs or distracted.
